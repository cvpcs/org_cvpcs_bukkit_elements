Minecraft Elements Project
==========================

The Elements Project is a Bukkit plugin designed to add elementalist RPG
gameplay to the game of Minecraft.  Each player is given the ability to
align with one of the elements, and in doing so gain several passive and
active elementalist abilities.

This plugin borrows heavily from the concepts put forth in the various
rune-based mods (such as Runecraft or EekRunes), as well as the Demigods
plugin.

Passive Abilities
-----------------

Passive abilities are powers that a player is given simply for being aligned
with a given element.  They have no cost to the player and work continuously
without any need to activate them.

### Fire

* Damage reduction from fire
* Fire damage only maintains while in fire or lava

### Water

* Damage reduction from drowning
* Increased underwater stamina

### Earth

* Damage reduction from suffocating

### Air

* Damage reduction from falling
